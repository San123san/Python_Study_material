In Python, arrays are typically referred to as lists. A list in Python is a versatile, ordered 
collection that can hold a variety of data types, including integers, floats, strings, and even other lists

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how you can create and work with lists in Python:
```python
# Creating a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Accessing elements
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1

# Modifying elements
my_list[1] = 10

# Appending elements
my_list.append(6)

# Iterating through the list
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```
